# CSH_interlayer
Work perform during my Bachelor's project. The goal was to identify a method to analyze the interlayer charge distribution of a CSH structure.

## Qualitative overview
### cells_location.ipynb
Program to locate a cell relatively to each other. This is done for a NxMxL CSH structure build with the pyCSH brick code.
### contour_initial.ipynb
Program to compute contours plot in the bc plane and in the ab plane for the initial structure.
### contour_bc.ipynb
Program to compute contours plot in the bc plane through the simulation.
### contour_ab.ipynb
Program to compute contours plot in the ab plane through the simulation.

## Quantitative overview
### cell_gamma.ipynb
Program to compute the dispersion index of the interlayer, given the definition made in the project.
### enthalpy.ipynb
Program to compute the enthalpy of a structure through the simulations in order to understand the energetical stability of the structure.
### polyhedrons.ipynb
Program to analyse the polyhedron of the interlayer built with VESTA vizualizer.

## Comments
This work has been performed by a Bachelor student, there is a lot of unknown and imprecisions that should be fixed in order to get a rigorous method to describe the charge distribution of the interlayer.
The work has been performed under Ziga Casar and Pr. Paul Bowen supervisions.
