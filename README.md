# CSH_interlayer
Work perform during my Bachelor's project. The goal was to identify a method to analyze the interlayer charge distribution of a CSH structure.
## General
### data
All the datas used are stored in the data folder, it contain the polyhedron as well as the structures and simulations files. They are stored in subfolder according to the analysis performed on each ones.
### Project
The project is stored in the project.pdf file, it provide all the informations needed regarding to this work.
## Qualitative overview
### cells_location.ipynb
Program to locate a cell relatively to each other. This is done for a NxMxL CSH structure build with the pyCSH brick code.
### contours_initial.ipynb
Program to compute contours plot in the bc plane and in the ab plane for the initial structure.
### contours_bc.ipynb
Program to compute contours plot in the bc plane through the simulation.
### contours_ab.ipynb
Program to compute contours plot in the ab plane through the simulation.

## Quantitative overview
### nna_distance.ipynb
Program to compute the nna distance analysis through the interlayer.
### gamma.ipynb
Program to compute the dispersion index of the interlayer, given the definition made in the project.
### enthalpy.ipynb
Program to compute the enthalpy of a structure through the simulations in order to understand the energetical stability of the structure.
### polyhedrons.ipynb
Program to analyse the polyhedron of the interlayer built with VESTA vizualizer.

## Comments
This work has been performed by a Bachelor student, there is a lot of unknown and imprecisions that should be fixed in order to get a rigorous method to describe the charge distribution of the interlayer.
The work has been performed under Ziga Casar and Pr. Paul Bowen supervisions.
